# LangGraph
Small projects using LangGraph and Tivaly (Web Search API to retrieve up-to-date data).

## Search job
- Using _gpt-5_ as a llm, and _TavilySearch_ to show me internship job postings that requires LLM and langchain knowledge.

- *Observations*:
  
    -_GPT-5_ is slower than its previous versions.
  
    -_TavilySearch_ helps to bring up-to-date information to be processed by the LLM (GPT-5).
